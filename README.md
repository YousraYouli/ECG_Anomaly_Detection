# 💓 ECG Anomaly Detection using Deep Learning Autoencoders

## 🧠 Overview
This project is a **Deep Learning mini project** focused on detecting anomalies in **ECG (Electrocardiogram)** signals using **GRU** and **LSTM-based Autoencoders**.  
It includes a **Streamlit web app** for real-time ECG analysis, reconstruction visualization, and anomaly detection.

Developed collaboratively as part of a university **Deep Learning project**.

## ⚙️ Key Features
- GRU & LSTM autoencoder architectures (PyTorch)  
- Anomaly detection on ECG time-series data  
- Streamlit interface for uploading, analyzing, and visualizing results  
- Pretrained models and convergence plots  

## 🚀 Quick Start
```bash
pip install torch streamlit pandas numpy matplotlib
cd deployment
streamlit run app.py
